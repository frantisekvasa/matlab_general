% Function to retain most consistent edges derived from (deterministic)
% tractography, but after estimating consistency within "bins" of edges
% based on their length (to avoid preferential retention of short edges).
% The procedure is separately performed on within- and between-hemispheric
% edges, to avoid preferential retention of one class or the other.
%
% The idea was first proposed in the following paper:
% Misic, Betzel et al. (2015) Cooperative and Competitive Spreading
% Dynamics on the Human Connectome, Neuron 86, 1518–1529.
%
% This was then subsequently applied in:
% Seidlitz et al. (2018) Morphometric Similarity Networks Detect Microscale
% Cortical Organization and Predict Inter-Individual Cognitive Variation, 
% Neuron 97, 231–247.

% Inputs:
% mat_all           array of tractography-derived (sparse) matrices,
%                   of dimension [N(ROI) x N(ROI) x N(subj)]
%
% dist              distance matrix - here, a single matrix common across
%                   all subjects, derived for example using euclidean
%                   distance between region centroids
%                   (alternatively, the code could be modified to use e.g.
%                   subject-specific distance matrices from tractography)
%
% lh_id             ID's of regions in left hemisphere
% rh_id             ID's or regions in right hemisphere
%                   -> e.g. for a matrix with 100 regions per hemisphere,
%                   ordered as LH -> RH, the ID's would be
%                   lh_id = 1:100; rh_id = 101:200
%
% optional:
% weighted          binary flag determining whether final matrix is weighted
%                   by the median weight (across subjects) of retained edges
%                   (default = 1 == weighted output)
%
% Outputs
% mat_cons         length-based consensus-thresholded matrix (binary)
%
% mat_cons_wei      IF weighted = 1: length-based consensus-thresholded
%                   matrix, weighted by median weight of retained edges
